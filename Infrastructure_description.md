# Infrastructure Description

I used in this project AWS services.

The services used are as follows:

## RDS:

Relational Database Service: Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a collection of managed services that makes it simple to set up, operate, and scale databases in the cloud.

## S3:

Simple Storage Service: Amazon S3 is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as data lakes, websites, cloud-native applications, backups, archive, machine learning, and analytics.

## Elastic Beanstalk:

Elastic Beanstalk is a service for deploying and scaling web applications and services. Upload your code and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deploymentâ€”from capacity provisioning, load balancing, and auto scaling to application health monitoring.
